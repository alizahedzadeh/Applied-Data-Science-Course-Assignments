# Applied Data Science Course Assignments

This repository is for assingments in the Applied Data Science course.

This course was held in the fall of 2023 under the supervision of [Dr. Salvati](https://github.com/saloot) at [Teias Institute](https://teias.institute/computer-science-department/).

We have implemented the answers to the assignments of this lesson with the participation of [Melika Nobakhtian](https://github.com/MelikaNobakhtian)

## Overview

In this course, our aim is to get STARTED on using data science in practice, either for academic projects or problems in the industry which we might face later on in our careers.

The course is more about breadth than depth, so we try to cover a lot of topics, but we won’t get too deep in them, as it would take “forever”!

We go over all steps of a data problem workflow, namely:

Gathering Data → Cleaning → Preprocessing → Analysis → Visualization

Throughout this process, we work on several different sample problems in the lab sessions as well as through homeworks and final projects, in order to be familiar with for various type of problems usually faced in data science.
